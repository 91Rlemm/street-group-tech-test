### StreetGroup Technical Test

#### Summary

Please find my technical test attempt, i spent about 2 hours 10 mins, writing and cleaning up my visual mess as i'm not a strong frontend developer.

The setup should be a simple Laravel spin up

- ```Composer install```
- ``php artisan migrate``

This will give you everything you need to have a look.

The ``/`` route is the entry point for the application and will allow you to upload a CSV file and push it to the controller 
where it will be processed.

Please note i used PHP8.1 so please use a similar version when evaluating/running as such features Constructor property promotion only work on 8.0+
